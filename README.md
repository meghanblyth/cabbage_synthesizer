#### C sound Synthesiser created in Cabbage

The following synthesiser was created using ‘Cabbage’ framework for audio development and ‘C sound’ music computing system.  The synthesiser contains a variety of sound synthesis including an ADSR envelope, additive synthesis using partials and Frequency modulation. 

The sound basis for this synthesiser is a Sine wave.  The keyboard portion of the widget has a ten-octave range which is controlled using the yellow arrows on the right and left-hand side.  

There are five group boxes within the synthesiser. The first is an envelope on the top left corner containing four slider dials to control the Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release parameters of the sound.  As with all dials on the synthesiser the dials can be controlled by clicking on the dial and sliding a mouse or track pad up and down. 

The second group box can be found on the bottom left of the synthesiser.  This contains the slider dials which control Low Frequency Oscillation (LFO) and Amplitude Modulation.  

The third group box centre left contains slider dials to control additive synthesis in the form of six partials, partial 2 to partial seven inclusive.   

The fourth group box, found in the top right corner, contains three slider controls for Frequency Modulation.  These include a Modulator Multiplier, Harmonicity Index and Frequency Multiplier.  

The final box, which is located on the bottom right corner, contains the Master Volume which controls the volume for all aspects of the synthesiser. 

Using combinations of the sliders, multiple methods of synthesis can be created and adjusted by the user.  

The code used to create this synthesiser has been adapted from the work of Rory Walsh, Hugh McCarthy and others.
